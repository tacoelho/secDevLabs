## Build your lab

By provisioning local environments via docker-compose, you will learn how the most critical web application security risks are exploited and how these vulnerable codes can be fixed to mitigate them. üë©‚Äçüíª

## How do I start?

After forking this repository, you will find multiple intended vulnerable apps based on real-life scenarios in various languages such as Golang, Python and PHP. A good start would be installing the ones you are most familiar with. You can find instructions to do this on each of the apps. üí°

Each of them has an `Attack Narrative` section that describes how an attacker would exploit the corresponding vulnerability.  Before reading any code, it may be a good idea following these steps so you can better understand the attack itself. üíâ

Now it's time to shield the application up! Imagine that this is your application and you need to fix these flaws! Your mission is writing new codes that mitigate them and sending a new Pull Request to deploy a secure app! üîê

## How secure is my new code?

After mitigating a vulnerability, you can send a Pull Request to gently ask the secDevLabs community to review your new secure codes. If you're feeling a bit lost, try having a look at [this mitigation solution](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs/pull/29), it might help! üöÄ
